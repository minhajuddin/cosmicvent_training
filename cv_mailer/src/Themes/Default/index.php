						My crew is all fired up
						Y'all better just wise up
						Everybody gettin' sized up
						Before we all rise up
						<a href="#">Start runnin'</a> your times up
						Cuz' when my crew ride up
						The sky gon' light up
						Everybody get FIRED UP!!!
					</p><p>
						I walk this planet the most rugged
						Most can only see this heat but don't touch it
						Cuz' you might get 'em burned
						When I come through it's my turn
						Never get in my way or you're getting' rolled over
						Like Rover cuz' my fist's a bulldozer
						I throw these dogs in the street to melodys
						Like a heartbeat playing against piano keys
						It's a breeze 365 degrees
						Turn around and you might catch these so just freeze
						A riddle with no clues I'm a walking nightmare
						Anywhere anytime boy I don't fight fair
						A day in my shoes is a day with no fear
						So walk barefooted and save your whole year
						And I wear a mouthpiece cuz' I grit my teeth
						So just bite your tongue before you get your ass beat...
					</p>
					<p>
						In the club to a beat
						In the street wit' a beef in the heat
						EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!
						If it's black or it's white
						If it's wrong or it's right day or night
						EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!
						Don't matter if you win or you lose
						Only one thing to do
						EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!
						Put it down every town every city
						If you feel me and you wit' me
						EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!
					</p><p>
						I'm an S.O.B.
						That's a son of a bitch homie you don't know me
						I was put here to slap you silly and clap Billy
						And clap everything in the track like Mac Milly's
						And that's just the half really
						You don't wanna see the other side I suggest you act quickly
						And ran swiftly and get outta my way before the gats empty
						(C'MON!!!) and just tempt me...
