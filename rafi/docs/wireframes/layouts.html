			I've been doing ASP.NET for a while, mostly at my current employer where 
			we make large-scale online banking web sites. During that, what I've 
			noticed more and more as new features come out for ASP.NET is that 
			there's a heavy focus on rapid application development - drag, drop, and ship - 
			and less around the idea of creating a commercial application using ASP.NET. 
			There are a few products like Community Server and DotNetNuke out there, 
			but not many (or not as many as there could be) and I'd wager a lot 
			of it has to do with lack of framework support for that sort of app.
			
			To put what I'm talking about in context, let me first describe at 
			a high level the kind of application I'm working on. Customers might want 
			to have us host the application for them or they might want 
			to host it themselves, so it needs to be something fairly easy to 
			deploy. In a hosted environment, the customers want to be able to change 
			their settings easily, so there's a sort of "configuration user interface" 
			that has to be put in place. Changes might include not only application 
			settings, but text that appears on the various pages, so localization comes 
			into play. It needs to be easily upgraded, deployed, and managed, so you don't 
			want a full copy of the application out there for every customer; 
			you want a single copy with different IIS apps pointing at it... but that 
			means the application has to support multi-tenancy (you can't just stick all 
			your config in web.config because there's only one, right?). In a custom 
			deployment, the application will be taken by a team, put into the customer's 
			environment, and programmatically customized, which means it needs to have a 
			lot of extensibility points.

			So, with that context, here are the big challenges.
			Multi-Tenancy Everything in the .NET framework assumes there's only 
			one tenant running on the application. When you ask for a configuration 
			value, the value comes from The One Configuration Source and that's that. 
			There's no qualifier in there anywhere to say "I want this configuration 
			value for this specific tenant." You have to write that. If you want a default
